DIY Blockchain
==============

[![js-standard-style](https://cdn.rawgit.com/feross/standard/master/badge.svg)](https://github.com/feross/standard)
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/phramz/diy-blockchain.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/phramz/diy-blockchain)

## Build & Run

DIY will run within your browser as well as from CLI:
* The CLI mode will auto-connect to the p2p nodes and start mining. It will expose HTTP on http://localhost:8080
* The in-browser mode lets you control the application via javascript-console. E.g. try `diy.p2p.connect()` or `diy.miner.start()` 

### Testdrive

A running instance can be found at [diy.hhx2.com](https://diy.hhx2.com/).
